# Backend Notes

## Learning Concepts in Backend Design

In this section, we delve into the foundational concepts essential for designing a robust backend system.

## Learning Standard Coding Practices

Here, we explore the industry-standard coding practices vital for developing efficient backend solutions.

## Project Setup

### Initializing Project with npm

To kickstart our project, we initialize the `package.json` file using `npm init`.

### Installing Required Packages

We install necessary packages such as Express for handling server requests and responses.

### Automating Server Restart

Nodemon is employed to automate server restarts, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

### Structuring Project Directory

We organize our project directory with essential folders like `controllers`, `db`, `middlewares`, `models`, `routes`, and `utils`, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

### Enforcing Code Formatting Standards

The project adheres to industry-standard code formatting practices facilitated by the Prettier npm package.

## MongoDB Connection

### Setting up MongoDB Atlas

We create an account on MongoDB Atlas and configure initial settings, including cluster creation, setting up username and password, and defining IP address restrictions.

### Configuring Environment Variables

Sensitive information such as database connection strings are stored in a `.env` file, enhancing security.

### Writing Database Connection Logic

We implement the logic for establishing a connection to MongoDB, emphasizing error handling using try-catch blocks and async-await syntax.

### Handling Asynchronous Operations

Efficient handling of asynchronous operations is ensured, leveraging try-catch blocks and async-await syntax to manage potential errors.

## Understanding Express

### Exploring Request and Response Handling

We explore request and response handling mechanisms in Express, including installation of middleware packages such as `cookie-parser` and `cors`.

### Middleware Configuration

Middleware functions are utilized to intercept and modify request and response objects, facilitating additional functionalities like authentication checks.

## Understanding AsyncHandler (src/utils/asyncHandler.js)

### Simplifying Error Handling

Express-async-handler simplifies error handling for asynchronous operations in Express.js, enhancing code readability and cleanliness.

## Understanding ApiError.js (src/utils/ApiError.js)

### Custom Error Handling

The `ApiError` class is introduced to create custom error objects tailored for API-related errors, providing structured error handling mechanisms including status codes, error messages, and stack traces.

### Leveraging Inheritance

By extending the Error class, we leverage inheritance to override functionalities and handle errors in a customized manner, ensuring robust error management within the API system.
